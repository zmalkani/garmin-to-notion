- **60+ activity types** — running, cycling, swimming, strength, BJJ, climbing, winter sports, and more
- **Auto-discovery** — finds your Notion databases by name, no manual IDs needed
- **Timezone-aware** — configurable via `TIMEZONE` variable, all timestamps are correct
- **Zero-touch automation — runs 3x/day via GitHub Actions (free tier friendly))

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Fork this repository

Click **Fork** on GitHub to create your own copy.

### Step 2: Set up your Notion template

**Option A — Notion AI (recommended):**
1. Open a new Notion page
2. Copy the full contents of [`docs/notion-ai-prompt.txt`](docs/notion-ai-prompt.txt)
3. Paste it into Notion AI — it will create the complete template with all databases, views, and charts
4. Follow the post-creation checklist in [`docs/notion-template-setup.md`](docs/notion-template-setup.md) to convert date filters to relative

**Option B — Duplicate template:**
Coming soon — a public template you can duplicate in one click.

### Step 3: Create Notion integration

1. Go to [notion.so/profile/integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations)
2. Click **New integration** → name it "Garmin Sync" → select **Internal**
3. Copy the integration token (starts with `ntn_`)
4. Go to your **Fitness Tracker** page in Notion → click `...` → **Connect to** → **Garmin Sync**

All inline databases inherit access automatically — no need to connect each one individually.

### Step 4: Add GitHub Secrets

Go to your fork's **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets** and add:

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `GARMIN_EMAIL` | Your Garmin Connect email |
| `GARMIN_PASSWORD` | Your Garmin Connect password |
| `NOTION_TOKEN` | Your Notion integration token |

### Step 5: Set Variables (optional)

Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables** and add:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TIMEZONE` | `UTC` | Your IANA timezone (e.g. `America/Sao_Paulo`, `Europe/London`) |
| `GARMIN_DAYS_BACK` | `30` | Days of sleep/steps history to sync |
| `GARMIN_ACTIVITIES_FETCH_LIMIT` | `1000` | Max activities to fetch per sync |

### Step 6: Run!

Go to the **Actions** tab → **Garmin to Notion Sync** → **Run workflow**.

Your data will appear in Notion within a few minutes. After that, the sync runs automatically 3 times a day (6am, 2pm, 10pm UTC).

## How It Works

```
Garmin Connect API
    │
    ├──→ Activities DB ──→ Workouts DB ──┐
    ├──→ Personal Records DB             ├──→ Activity Summary DB
    ├──→ Daily Steps DB ─────────────────┘         (monthly/yearly)
    └──→ Sleep DB ───────────────────────┘
```

Activities, Personal Records, Daily Steps, and Sleep are synced independently from the Garmin API. Workouts are derived from Activities. Activity Summary aggregates data from Workouts, Daily Steps, and Sleep into monthly and yearly overviews.

## Configuration

### GitHub Secrets (required)

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `GARMIN_EMAIL` | Your Garmin Connect email |

### GitHub Variables (optional)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TIMEZONE` | `UTC` | IANA timezone for activity timestamps |
| `GARMIN_DAYS_BACK` | `30` | Days of sleep/steps history to sync |
| `GARMIN_ACTIVITIES_FETCH_LIMIT` | `1000` | Max activities per sync |

### Database IDs (optional — auto-discovered by default)

If auto-discovery doesn't work, you can set these as secrets:

| Secret | Database |
|---|---|
| `NOTION_DB_ID` | Activities |
| `NOTION_PR_DB_ID` | Personal Records |
| `NOTION_STEPS_DB_ID` | Daily Steps |
| `NOTION_SLEEP_DB_ID` | Sleep |
| `NOTION_WORKOUTS_DB_ID` | Workouts |
| `NOTION_SUMMARY_DB_ID` | Activity Summary |

## Troubleshooting

### Sync fails with "429 Too Many Requests"
Garmin rate-limits API calls per account/IP. This happens when the sync runs too often (e.g. hourly) — every run exchanges an OAuth2 token, and repeated hourly exchanges trip the limit, after which every hourly retry keeps it tripped.

To recover:
1. **Pause the schedule for ~24 hours** — go to **Actions → Garmin to Notion Sync → ⋯ → Disable workflow**, then re-enable it the next day. This lets Garmin's rate limit reset.
2. **Keep the default 3x/day schedule** (`0 6,14,22 * * *`). Avoid running more often than that.
3. Avoid manual reruns during the cooldown window — they perform the same OAuth exchange and can keep the limit tripped.
4. If it still fails after the cooldown, regenerate your tokens locally (`python scripts/generate_tokens.py`) and update the `GARMIN_TOKENS` secret.

Transient 429s are retried automatically with backoff; if Garmin is still limiting after the retries, that run is skipped with a warning (not a failure) and the next scheduled run tries again.

### Charts show errors
Run the Notion AI update prompt ([`docs/notion-ai-update-prompt.txt`](docs/notion-ai-update-prompt.txt)) to recreate all views and charts. Make sure your databases have data first — charts won't render on empty databases.

### Wrong activity times
Set the `TIMEZONE` variable to your IANA timezone (e.g. `America/Sao_Paulo`). If you already have activities with wrong times, re-run `python -m garmin_to_notion activities` — it will detect and fix timezone mismatches automatically.

### Calendar views show empty months
Notion calendar views require a Date property. If a month appears empty, check that the sync has run and populated data for that period. For sleep and steps, increase `GARMIN_DAYS_BACK` to backfill older data.

### Activity Summary shows zero steps or sleep
Activity Summary aggregates from Workouts, Daily Steps, and Sleep databases. Make sure all three syncs have run at least once. Run `python -m garmin_to_notion all` to sync everything, then `python -m garmin_to_notion summary` to regenerate summaries.

### Sleep sync is slow on first run
The first sync fetches `GARMIN_DAYS_BACK` days of sleep data (default 30). For large backfills (e.g. `GARMIN_DAYS_BACK=3650`), the first run calls the Garmin API for each day without existing data. Subsequent syncs skip existing dates and are near-instant.

### Auto-discovery can't find databases
Make sure the Notion integration is connected to the **Fitness Tracker** page (not individual databases). Database names must match exactly: **Activities**, **Personal Records**, **Daily Steps**, **Sleep**, **Workouts**, **Activity Summary**.

## Acknowledgements

This project builds on the work of [Chloe Voyer](https://github.com/chloevoyer/garmin-to-notion), who created the original Garmin-to-Notion sync. We've extended it significantly — adding sleep tracking, activity summaries, 60+ activity types, emoji icons, timezone support, heatmap views, and a complete Notion template — but none of it would exist without her foundation. Thank you, Chloe.
